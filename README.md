# Projects Portfolio

This repository features a selection of data analysis projects completed during my education and internships. The projects span various domains and focus on data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation using **Python** and **R**. All work was developed using tools such as **Jupyter Notebooks**, **VS Code**, and **RStudio Cloud**.

## About Me

Iâ€™m currently completing a degree in **Data Analysis**, building on a background in **Marketing and Business**. This portfolio reflects both academic work and real-world projects, including internships focused on marine ecology and acoustic data analysis.

My tools include:

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **R** (ggplot2, sf, dplyr)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **VS Code**
- **RStudio Cloud**
- Basic **Tableau**
