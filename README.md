# Projects-Portfolio
This repository contains R scripts created during my internship with **Operation Wallacea**, focused on analyzing the **community structures of coral reef fishes in Honduras**.  
The work was part of a broader marine ecology research project conducted in the field.

Analyses were performed using `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and spatial mapping tools within **RStudio Cloud**.

## üìÅ Project Descriptions

- **Code_mapping_workshop_DGR.R**  
  Creates a spatial map of reef zones and boundaries using shapefiles and `ggplot2`. Highlights marine survey areas.

- **Hondmarines site.R**  
  Explores species distribution across different marine sites using scatter plots and site-level comparisons.

- **Honduras-Marine-Mapping.R**  
  Generates a bar plot showing the number of species per depth category, including error bars to visualize variability.

- **Pearson-correlation.R**  
  Tests and visualizes the correlation between fish length and biomass across sites.

- **R Workshop dragons Graph.R**  
  A stylized or illustrative graph created during R workshop sessions (for fun and learning purposes).

## üìå Notes
- All plots were created and exported using **RStudio Cloud**
- Data reflects fieldwork from **marine biodiversity surveys in Honduras**
