# Human Evolution Data Exploration

This project is a data analysis deep-dive into a structured dataset on early hominin species, created as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate **data cleaning, feature exploration, and visualization skills in Python**.

The dataset includes 12,000 entries and 28 variables such as:
- Cranial capacity
- Height
- Diet
- Locomotion (bipedalism, arm use, foot structure)
- Tooth and skull morphology
- Geography and migration

Key tasks included:
- Cleaning and renaming columns
- Checking for missing and duplicate values
- Summarizing numeric and categorical data
- Creating visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:
  - Histograms
  - Pie charts
  - Count plots

The project showcases my ability to quickly interpret and communicate patterns across large and diverse datasets.

> Tools: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
