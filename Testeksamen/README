This repository contains a complete **Quarto-based exam project** focused on analyzing and predicting **spectator attendance** at Viborg FF (VFF) home matches using data-driven methods.

The project combines statistical modeling and machine learning techniques with organizational analysis to explore how attendance predictions can support planning and decision-making in a professional football context.

Analyses were conducted in **R** using Quarto, with methods implemented through standard statistical and regularization frameworks.
